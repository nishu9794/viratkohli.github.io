        <h3>Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international
            cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team who plays for Royal Challengers
            Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Considered to be one of the best cricketers in the
            world, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport.[4] Nicknamed "The
            King", due to his dominant style of play and popularity, Kohli holds numerous records in his career across
            all formats. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli
            has also contributed to India's successes, captaining the team from 2014 to 2022, and winning the 2011 World
            Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy. He is among the only four Indian cricketers who have played over 500
            matches for India.[5]

            Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career
            with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the
            ODI team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC
            rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs
            scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test
            batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game.
            His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single
            decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is,
            following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.

            He has received many accolades for his performances on the cricket field. He was recognized as the ICC ODI
            Player of the Year in 2012 and has won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the
            Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Subsequently, Kohli also won ICC Test Player of the
            Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same
            year. Additionally, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from
            2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under
            the sports category in 2017 and the Khel Ratna award, India's highest sporting honour, in 2018.

            In 2016, he was ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN, and one of the most valuable
            athlete brands by Forbes. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people
            in the world. In 2020, he was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world
            for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of over $26 million. Kohli has been deemed one of the most
            commercially viable cricketers, with estimated earnings of ₹165 crore (US$21 million) in the year 2022.

                <div class="text-info ">head of the 2019 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Virat Kohli showed
                    how much faith he
                    had in the franchise by declaring that he would perhaps end his career with the Bangalore-based
                    Royal Challengers. The only player to be a part of a single franchise for the entire duration of the
                    tournament (right from the start of the cash-rich league in 2008), Kohli has developed an affection
                    with the franchise and with the fans over the period of time.Having been brought into the franchise
                    as a young emerging player in 2008, Kohli's growth has been stupendous. He learnt under the wings of
                    Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble, before finally establishing himself under Daniel Vettori. It wasn't a
                    free-flowing start, in a team that was struggling to find the essence of the tournament, it wasn't a
                    surprise that they had a struggling youngster in the midst. Having learnt the ropes in the first
                    three-year cycle, it wasn't a surprise that he was the only player retained in 2011. The purple
                    patch began somewhere around that region, he then proved it wasn't just a purple patch, it was a
                    career that was beginning to flourish. Soon after, Kohli became the best in all aspects, not just
                    white-ball cricket, but in the red-ball version as well.</div>
